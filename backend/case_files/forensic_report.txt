- Prescription medications: 
  * Lisinopril (blood pressure) - therapeutic levels
  * Atorvastatin (cholesterol) - therapeutic levels
- No illicit drugs detected
- No signs of poisoning

TIME OF DEATH ANALYSIS:
- Rigor mortis stage suggests death occurred between 13:45-14:15 hours
- Body temperature and lividity patterns consistent with estimated timeline
- Last meal: Light lunch, approximately 2-3 hours before death

ADDITIONAL FORENSIC FINDINGS:
- Victim's clothing showed no defensive wounds or struggle indicators
- Attack appears to have been sudden, from behind
- Library window examination: Fresh tool marks on latch (forced open from outside)

CONCLUSIONS:
The evidence suggests the perpetrator entered through the library window, approached the victim from behind while she was at her desk, and struck her with the crystal paperweight. The presence of expensive fabric on the window latch and the size 10-11 boot prints indicate an adult male perpetrator. The victim's appointment calendar entry and margin note suggest she may have discovered information relevant to her murder.
