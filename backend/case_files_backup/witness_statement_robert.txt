WITNESS STATEMENT (Recorded):

"My name is Robert Blackwood, and Victoria was my mother. I arrived at the manor around 2:00 PM today because Mother had called me this morning asking me to come over. She sounded... upset about something, but she wouldn't tell me what over the phone.

When I got there, I used my key to enter through the front door. I called out for Mother, but there was no answer. I checked the kitchen first - that's usually where she'd be having her afternoon tea. Elena, the housekeeper, wasn't there either, which was unusual.

I went to the library because that's Mother's favorite room. That's when I found her... lying on the floor. There was blood, and that paperweight - it's been on her desk for years. I immediately called 911.

About the family situation - look, I won't lie to you. Mother and I had our differences lately. She's been talking about changing her will, and honestly, it's been causing tension. My wife Margaret thinks Mother was being manipulated by someone, but I don't know by who.

Mother mentioned she had an appointment this afternoon with Thomas Hartwell, her lawyer. She said something about 'making things right' but wouldn't elaborate. I thought maybe she was finally going to settle some property disputes we've been having.

I haven't been to the manor in about two weeks. Margaret and I last visited on New Year's Day, and there was an argument about the estate. Mother accused Margaret of only caring about the inheritance, which wasn't fair. We left early that day.

I don't know who would want to hurt Mother. Yes, she could be difficult, and yes, there were family tensions, but murder? I can't imagine anyone actually... doing this to her.

The window being open is strange. Mother never opened the library window, especially not in January. She always complained about drafts. Someone must have come in that way.

I didn't touch anything in the library except to check if Mother was... if she was still alive. I couldn't find a pulse, so I called 911 immediately and waited for the police."
